			<p>HEROES (helping educators revive our economic success) is a standards-based classroom curriculum supplement and online platform for </p>
			<p>networking K-12 teachers to guest speakers from the community to apply students' academic content to the real world. The connections we</p>
			<p>foster between students and professional guest speakers have at least three important implications for students' future success:</p>
			<br/>
			<p>First, students are more engaged in their classroom learning because they understand how it is relevant to their success in college and</p>
			<p>their future careers.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Secondly, students gain broad exposure to diverse careers and professions in order to answer the question of what they want to be</p>
			<p>when they grow up.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Finally, students are empowered when they relate with community members who offer diverse experiences, knowledge, and skills such</p>
			<p>that students can begin to imagine themselves achieving similar outcomes in the future through hard work and perseverance.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			
			<p>CHANGE: We seek to develop business-education partnerships that will create transformational change in ways that businesses are able to</p>
			<p>successfully grow, connect with, and retain their customers through community support. We also value ways these relationships will bring</p>
			<p>transformational change to students’ education, so students are able to critically think and apply their education to their future college</p>
			<p>and career opportunities.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>KNOWLEDGE UTILIZATION AND APPLICATION: The business community understands the knowledge and skills the incoming workforce must have </p>
			<p>in order to be successful in a rapidly changing global market. We must share this understanding with students and educators at all levels to </p>
			<p>develop the critical thinking skills that are necessary to apply students’ daily learning to the real world. </p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>INNOVATION: We understand that the current students will be the next workforce of this nation. By connecting classroom learning to post-</p>
			<p>secondary professions, students will be able to innovatively create solutions for tomorrow’s challenges. By connecting with students and </p>
			<p>educators, businesses will benefit as they gain experience innovatively preparing students for college and career readiness, which ultimately </p>
			<p>will increase the quality of their future workforce.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			
			<p>DIVERSITY: We seek a diverse group of businesses to partner with educators to expose students and educators to the variety of ways</P>
			<p>academic content applies to the real world. This requires a diversity of professions to partner with our schools. Additionally, the future</p>
			<p>workforce is increasingly diverse culturally, and we strive to seek partnerships with community professionals who reflect the diversity of</p>
			<p>the students we serve. </p>
